# Diversical

Diversical is a (demo) calendar website dediated to making diversity events accessible to everyone. It is intended to make these events easy to find for those interested. Organisations are able to sign up with an account and upload events on the calendar for everyone to see and attend. 

The idea for this project started at a hackathon organised by Code First Girls (CFG) with the aim of using technology to help with diversity & inclusion. 

My team and I brainstormed this idea and were one of the finalists in the hackathon. I decided to continue working on the site after the hackathon to hone my skills. 

The project uses Vue.js with Vuetify for front-end. 

The site is deployed here for demo purposes: https://diversical.netlify.app/.
